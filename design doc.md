Design Document: LogPulse (BioTech Visual Direction)1. Design PhilosophyThe core objective is "Scientific Precision with Calm UI." Instead of overwhelming the user with dense data, the interface uses modular layouts, soft gradients, and clear grouping to make high-stakes data easy to scan and trust.2. Visual Identity & Color PaletteThe palette moves away from "high-alert" neon colors toward a more sophisticated, nature-inspired professional scheme.ElementHex CodePurposePrimary Background#F1F3F3Ultra-light gray for a clean, lab-like environment.Neutral Text#616164Subdued gray for secondary information and labels.Primary Accent#A09C5EMuted olive green for primary actions and "Healthy" status.Deep Accents#4A4A2CDark olive for high-contrast headers.Secondary Neutral#B4B4B4Mid-tone gray for borders and dividers.3. Layout StructureThe dashboard follows a Modular Grid System to separate concerns:Navigation Rail (Left): A slim, iconic sidebar to maximize data real estate.Header Section: Displays the specific research project name, breadcrumbs, and a "Global Search" bar.KPI Ribbon (Top): 4-5 small "Metric Cards" showing high-level stats (e.g., Protein Stability, Longevity Index).Main Visualization Area (Center): Uses a large, white-surface card for the primary graph (likely a complex line chart or 3D molecular visualization).Side Analytics Panel (Right): A dedicated vertical column for "AI Insights" or text-based research summaries.4. Typography & ComponentsTypeface: Clean, sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter or Plus Jakarta Sans) with generous letter spacing to ensure technical data remains legible.Cards: Uses soft rounded corners (12px - 16px) with very subtle drop shadows or light gray borders (#B4B4B4).Data Viz Components: * Line charts with smooth interpolation (curves, not sharp angles).Soft gradient fills under area charts to provide depth without clutter.Color-coded "Badge" system for fast status decisions.5. Key Features for ImplementationModular Layout: Each chart should be its own draggable or collapsible card.Calm Alerting: Instead of bright red popups, use muted "Warm Amber" or "Soft Red" tones that catch the eye without causing panic.Data Grouping: Logical sections for "Analytical Metadata" (who, when, what) versus "Core Results."

I recommend using Next.js with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/ui. Shadcn provides the exact minimalist, high-end look seen in this BioTech dashboard. For the charts, Recharts is the best choice to achieve those smooth, custom-colored gradients.
